# kleinsHTTP: A stupid stupidly simple http server.

## About

I wanted to create an api server using C++ as it is my favorite language however i was unable to find a http libary that fits my requirements.

Those requirements being:
- Simple to understand
- Simple to get working
- Easy to implement

So i wrote this libary. I don't know if this makes sense to other people, but it works for me.

## Building

You can build either in debug or release mode using

```make```

or

``make release``

respectivly.

This will create all necessary files under `target/debug|release/`.

### Linking it staticly

Include kleinsHTTP.h in your project.
Add kleinsHTTP.a to your source files.

### Linking it dynamicly

Include kleinsHTTP.h in your project.
Move libkleinsHTTP.so to `/usr/lib/`

## Example:

Check out [SimpleExample](./examples/simpleHelloWorld/main.cpp) on how to use this libary.

(I'm still working on better documentaion. Sorry!)
